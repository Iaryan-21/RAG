# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model. RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses. The model leverages a knowledge base to retrieve relevant documents and utilizes a generative model to synthesize the final response.


## Introduction

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach for natural language processing tasks that require both the retrieval of relevant information and the generation of coherent responses. This project implements a RAG model, demonstrating its effectiveness in tasks such as question answering and information retrieval.

## Features

- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines retrieval and generation to improve response accuracy.
- **Scalable**: Utilizes a scalable architecture for handling large datasets.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different domains and datasets.

## Model Architecture

The RAG model architecture consists of two main components:

1. **Retriever**: Searches a knowledge base to retrieve relevant documents.
2. **Generator**: Generates the final response based on the retrieved documents.

## Dataset

This implementation uses a sample dataset to demonstrate the functionality of the RAG model. You can customize the dataset to fit your specific use case. Ensure that your dataset is in a compatible format for retrieval and generation tasks.

## Results

The RAG model shows promising results in various NLP tasks. Below are some sample outputs demonstrating its capabilities:

- **Input**: "What is magma?"
- **Output**: "Magma is molten rock stored beneath the Earth's surface."

- **Input**: "What is a hill?"
- **Output**: "A hill is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain. It often has a distinct summit."

- **Input**: "How does wind affect soil erosion?"
- **Output**: "Wind can cause soil erosion by blowing loose soil particles away, especially in dry and barren areas."

- **Input**: "What is the longest river in the world?"
- **Output**: "The Nile River is traditionally considered the longest river in the world, stretching over 6,650 kilometers (4,130 miles)."

## Deployment

After RAG preprocessing, the Gemma-2-9b-it model has been deployed and used on the pre-trained version of it. This deployment allows for enhanced response generation by leveraging the pre-trained capabilities of the Gemma-2-9b-it model.
